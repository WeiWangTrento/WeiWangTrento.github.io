I joined BJTU in August.

***
Before joining BJTU, I was an assistant Professor at <a href="http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/people">MHUG</a> group in University of Trento, Italy. 
I was also a post-doc researcher in <a href="https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/">CVLab</a> at EPFL.

#### Research topic list
<ul>
    <li>Hand Segmentation</li>
    <li>Differentiable SVD</li>
    <li>Face Synthesis</li>
    <li>Action Recognition</li>
</ul>
