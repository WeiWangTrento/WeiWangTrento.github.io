**About Me** <br />
I am currently a Professor in the Institute of Information Science at BJTU.
Before joining BJTU, I was an Assistant Professor in the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [CVLab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, working with Prof. [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=112366&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en).
I received Ph.D Degree from University of Trento in 2018, supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) in Multimedia and Human Understanding Group ([MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/)).
I was a visiting student from 2015 to 2016 in the Learning and Vision (LV) Group at National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/) and Prof. [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).
More details can be found [here](/cv/).

**Research Interests**:
My research interests include computer vision and machine learning.
- Computer Vision: 
  - image/video generation, style transfer, segmentation, classification
  - with specific interest on *face analysis* including face landmark detection, face aging, face expression video synthesis, etc. <br />
- Machine Learning: 
  - Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) (used for second-order pooling, style transfer, etc.)
  - Position Embedding in Vision Transformer, etc.

**Prospective Students**: I am looking for self-motivated Master and Ph.D students to join my group. 
If you are interested, please drop me an email with your CV and clearly state your English skills, coding skills, and research interests.
Besides, outstanding BJTU undergraduates are welcome to join our projects, please feel free to contact me.
