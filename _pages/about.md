**About Me** <br />
I am currently a Professor in the Institute of Information Science at BJTU.
Before joining BJTU, I was an Assistant Professor in the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [CVLab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, working with Prof. [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=112366&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en).
I received Ph.D Degree from University of Trento in 2018, supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/) in Multimedia and Human Understanding Group ([MHUG](http://mhug.disi.unitn.it/#/)).
I was a visiting student from 2015 to 2016 in the Learning and Vision (LV) Group at National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/) and Prof. [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).
More details can be found [here](/cv/).
