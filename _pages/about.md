Before joining BJTU, I was an Assistant Professor (RTDa) in the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [CVLab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/), working with Prof. [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=112366&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en).
I received Ph.D Degree from University of Trento, supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/).
I was a visiting student from 2015 to 2016 in the Learning and Vision (LV) Group at National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/) and Prof. [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
