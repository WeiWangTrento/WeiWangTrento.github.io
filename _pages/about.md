Before joining BJTU, I was an Assistant Professor in the [University of Trento](https://www.unitn.it/en), Italy. 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in [CVLab](https://cvlab.epfl.ch/) at [EPFL](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) in Switzerland, working with Prof. [Pascal Fua](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=112366&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en) and Dr. [Mathieu Salzmann](https://people.epfl.ch/cgi-bin/people?id=119864&op=bio&lang=en&cvlang=en).

I received Ph.D Degree from University of Trento, supervised by Prof. [Nicu Sebe](http://disi.unitn.it/~sebe/).
I was a visiting student from 2015 to 2016 in the Learning and Vision (LV) Group at National University of Singapore (NUS), working with [Prof. Shuicheng Yan](https://www.ece.nus.edu.sg/stfpage/eleyans/) and Prof. [Jiashi Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/jshfeng/).

I got my Master of Engineering degree from Southern Denmark University, and Bachelor of Science degree from Northwestern Polytechnical University.

**Research Interests**:
My research interests include computer vision and machine learning. <br />
- Computer Vision: image/video generation, style transfer, segmentation, classification, vision & language, <br />
with specific interest on *face analysis* including face landmark detection, face aging, face synthesis, etc. <br />
- Machine Learning: numerical methods for deep learning (e.g. second-order pooling), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Position Embedding in Vision Transformer, etc. <br />
